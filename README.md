Add lock screen for Logseq, that would make your notes safer a little bit maybe.

## Usage

When you trigger lock screen, it will show you a random backgroud with a pattern lock which like the Android lock screen.

Everytime you trigger it, you must set a pattern to lock the screen, if not, you can press `q`, `ESC` or `mod+alt+l` to close the window. But once you set the pattern, you must use the same pattern to unlock and then the lock window closed.

If you do not like the random backgroud, you can click the right top corner icon button to get another random background.

Please note, the lock screen idea is just for fun, it can not protect your note ideally!

## Trigger

* Toolbar icon
* Shortcut: `mod+alt+l`

## Settings

You can config in the plugin settings JSON file.

* `showToolbarIcon`: whether showing toolbar icon or not.
* `keyBindings.lockScreen`: change the trigger shortcut.

## FAQ

* What if I forget my password?
  * Just restart your Logseq or press `mod+r` to reload Logseq window.
* What lock screen backgroud not changed?
  * It can only change after you restart or reload Logseq, or you can press the right top corner button on lock screen.
